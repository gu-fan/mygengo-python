Gengo Python Library (for the [Gengo API](http://gengo.com/))
========================================================================================================
Translating your tools and products helps people all over the world access them; this is, of course, a
somewhat tricky problem to solve. **[Gengo](http://gengo.com/)** is a service that offers human-translation
(which is often a higher quality than machine translation), and an API to manage sending in work and watching
jobs. This is a python interface to make using the API simpler (some would say incredibly easy).

Installation & Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the library is fairly simple:

Get the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/myGengo/mygengo-python.git

And then install the library:

    sudo python setup.py install

This will also install the `requests` package. If you're running on a version of Python prior to 2.6, you'll need to install simplejson as well:

     sudo pip install simplejson

A version of Gengo for Python 3 is in the works, but as Python 3 isn't even quite deemed production
ready/reliable yet, it's not the highest priority at the moment.


Tests - Running Them, etc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gengo has a full suite of Unit Tests. To run them, grab the source, head into the mygengo directory,
and execute the tests file with the Python interpreter, ala:

    python tests.py

Note that some of the tests rely on some deferred actions so there are timeouts (sleep) which you might have to adjust.

Question, Comments, Complaints, Praise?

Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full documentation can be found **[here](http://developers.gengo.com)**, but anyone should be able to cobble together
a working script with the following:

``` python
from mygengo import MyGengo

gengo = MyGengo(
    public_key = 'your_public_key',
    private_key = 'your_private_key',
    sandbox = True, # possibly false, depending on your dev needs
)

print gengo.getAccountBalance()
```

All function definitions can be found inside mygengo/mockdb.py as a dictionary: the
key of the dictionary entry is the function name, and the parameters are exactly the same as specified
over on the **[Gengo API docs](http://developers.gengo.com)**.
